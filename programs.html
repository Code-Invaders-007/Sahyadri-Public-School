              <p> At Sahyadri School, we believe that every child deserves a strong start to their educational journey.
                Our kindergarten program is designed to provide a nurturing and engaging environment that fosters a love
                of learning and prepares children for success in the years ahead. Through a mix of play-based
                activities, structured lessons, and social-emotional learning, we help our youngest students build the
                foundational skills they need to thrive academically, socially, and emotionally.</p>
